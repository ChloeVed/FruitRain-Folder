# FruitRain-Folder

Download all of the files from GitHub as a zip file.

You will need to open the FruitRain.pde file and go to around line 448 and
paste in the file location of QuizQuestions.csv. You can do this by locating them in
your file explorer, right clicking the section that shows all of the folder names,
and clicking "Copy address". Then paste the addresses in place of the pre-written
addresses, add an extra "\" to each one present in the new address, followed by two
backslashes and the file name.

E.g.: C:\\Users\\username\\Downloads\\FruitRain-Folder\\FruitRain_Feb27th_BuildB\\FruitRain\\QuizQuestions.csv

Confirm that the file paths work as intended; if there is something wrong, an error
should occur upon attempting to run the program.

While you have this file open, you will need to download the Sound library;
to do so, click on Sketch, then hover over Import Library, then click Add Library
(depending on your version of Processing it may be a different option).
Search for the Sound Library and download. If no errors occur when attempting to
play the music, then you've done this step correctly. You will also need to download the GifAnimation library.

Hook up the Makey-Makey controller to your PC and connect an apple, orange,
banana, and lime to the controller's up, down, left, and right dpad areas respectively
with alligator connectors. These dpad directions should be mapped to the corresponding
arrow keys on your keyboard. If fruit and/or makey-makey controllers are not available,
we recommend colored stickers on the arrow keys instead, as there is otherwise no
indication of what to press.

Players will tap the fruit that corresponds with their guess to a provided question.
We suggest printing out a word document briefly explaining the following java concepts:
variables, strings (including concatenation), and conditionals (if, else, and
while loops).
