C. Figure out how to manually de-spawn the fruit temporarily after making a guess (this isn't mandatory)
D. Have the draw() loop add one health point to the player's score every 6 questions [this must be done in a way that ensures 1 health point is not added every frame when (quizIndex + 1)%6 == 0
E. Add music
